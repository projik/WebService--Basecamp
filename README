Basecamp is a web based project collaboration tool that makes it simple to
communicate and collaborate on projects. Basecamp is built on the Ruby on Rails
platform but provides a webservice API to many of the application functions.
WebService::Basecamp is a Perl interface to the Basecamp web service API.

For more information on Basecamp, visit the Basecamp website.
http://www.basecamphq.com.

This module does much of the heavy lifting for you when accessing the Basecamp
API. Once initialising a WebService::Basecamp object you can access the API
function via method calls. The module takes care of the creation and parsing of
the XML (using XML::Simple) that relays the data across the web service, however
there is an option to access the XML directly (see new()).

The documentation for this module is based on the Basecamp API docs available at
http://www.basecamphq.com/api. It is recommended you read the official docs to
become familiar with the data reference.
